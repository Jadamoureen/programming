Printing in Python 
------------------

Python programmers prefer to be explicit, to choose simple over complex and to maximize readability. 

*print()function*

print() is a function in Python 3. More specifically, it’s a built-in function, which means that you don’t need to import it from anywhere


Assigning **"Hello World!" to the variable my_text**
when printing a variable with print function one shouldn't use quotes but if you're **printing a string directly with print()function then quotes should be used**


```my_text = "Hello World!"
print(my_text)```

 Redefine print() so that it doesn’t append a trailing newline. At the same time, you wanted to rename the original function to something like println()

 ```println('Hello')```

 ```print('Hello\n')```

 

Printing in Java
-----------------

> System.out is the name of the an object that knows how to display or print characters in a terminal window 

> Println is the name of the message being sent to the System.out object

> The strings enclosed in quotation marks contain the characters to be printed
Semicolons (;) mark the end of each statement or sentence in the program
